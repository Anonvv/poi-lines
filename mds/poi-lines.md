This might be the first time I feel I like belong.

> I learned everyone dies alone.      
我学到了，每个人都会孤身死去。      
But if you mean something to someone.       
但如果你对某人很重要。      
If you helped someone or loved someone.     
如果你帮过某人或爱过某人。      
If even a single person remembers you.      
哪怕只有一个人记得你。      
Then maybe you never really die.        
那么也许你就永远不会真正死去。      
And maybe this isn't the end at all.        
也许一切并未结束。
