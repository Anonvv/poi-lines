瞧这脸拉的，你的活泼可爱劲儿呢？可吓着我了。

S:

西蒙可有得受了。

S:
> Any chance the machine clued you in to what's going on?       
机器能不能跟你透露下这是在闹什么？

S:
> The way this guy's stonewalling. Maybe he's in on it.     
看这家伙一直拦阻。也许他有份儿。

S:
> Nothing in the commissioner's email about the election being fixed. He's been dealing with that crazy employee all morning. Got a tip from an  anonymous account.	        
选举监察员的邮件中没显示选举被动了手脚。他整个早上都在处理那个发疯的员工。因为接到了匿名线报。

> Harold, Simon was about to get caught in the crossfire of a work dispute.     
哈罗德，西蒙差点卷进一起工作纠纷枪击案。

R:
> No. That's only what it was meant to look like. What Simon saw--the calls, the votes, the emails-- The election was fixed by something that can manipulate electronic signals without a trace. Samaritan rigged the election. Now it's cleaning up.       
不。那只是表面上。西蒙所见——电话、投票、邮件、选举被动了手脚。动手者可以毫无痕迹地操纵电子信号。撒马利亚人选举舞弊。现在杀人灭口。

## 3.3. 00:18:28--00:19:18

H:

撒马利亚人已经开始暗中介入人类活动了。

S:
> And it's killing to cover it up.      
而且还杀人掩罪。

R:
> It profiles unstable people like that guy. It anonymously sent evidence to get him fired and arrested, knowing he'd snap. He was an unwitting hit man. He'd kill the Commissioner, and Simon would be collateral damage.      
它分析侧写危险分子就像那位。然后匿名举报，让他被开除并逮捕。知道他一定会报复，让他无意中当了杀手。他会杀死监察员。而西蒙就是附带伤害。

H:
> If Simon tries to go public, he only puts himself in more danger. This must remain a cold war. He needs to keep quiet.        
如果西蒙向公众公开，他只会更加危险。冷战不能再升级了。他必须保持沉默。

S:
> So are you saying we just let this rigged election slide?     
你的意思是我们就眼睁睁放过选举舞弊？

H:
> No, Samaritan has positioned Perez to use the full executive powers of the State, which means she's integral to its plan. which means she's integral to its plan.     
不，撒马利亚人既然安排佩雷斯掌握全州的行政大权，那就是说她是它计划的一部分。我们得逼她辞职。

我会追查她的网络数据资料，但格罗夫斯女士，我需要你的帮助。

R:
> I thought you'd never ask.        
就怕你不问呢。

## 3.4. 00:23:38--00:24:33

我说两位，咱们有麻烦了，

H:

麻烦？

S:

S:

R:

马上退后。有特工冲西蒙来了。我想她是撒马利亚人。如果这样的话，她认得我们。

S:
> But if we don't do anything, Simon dies.      
但如果我们袖手旁观，西蒙会死。

R:
> That woman wasn't here for Simon. Samaritan sent her to kill Perez.       
那女人不是冲西蒙来的。撒马利亚人派她来杀佩雷斯。

We need keep Simon out of Samaritan's sight. This is why the machine give us a shadow map.

S:
> I threw her off the scent.        
我让她跟丢了。

H:

西蒙在逃。身边的人纷纷死去。他不知道原因，但知道自己有危险了。他必须远离监控。下一个十字路口对面有摄像头。他必须右转才能不被发现。

R:
> I'll give him a nudge.        
我帮他一把。

H:
> Whose car was that?       
这是谁的车？

R:
> Someone who needs a good mechanic. Keep your eye on the prize, Harold.        
反正得好好修一下了。盯好重点，哈罗德。

H:
> Simon's realized that his safest move is to hide, get off the grid until he can assess the situation. But the hotel will have security cameras.       
西蒙意识到了现在要安全必须躲起来，销声匿迹，直到查明真相。但酒店肯定安装了监控摄像头。

R:
> But the life I've led, a good end would be a privilege.       
但我这一生，早就不期待善终了。

H:

这场战争会很漫长，但必须赢，不惜任何代价。



# 4. S04E07

## 4.1. 00:13:44--00:15:45

R:
> He's hot. I mean, not "Hood and zip ties in a CIA safe house with ten hours to kill" hot, but...      
他挺辣呢。虽然不是“蒙头捆好扔到中情局安全屋纠缠十个小时”那种性感，不过…

T:
> Bartender, two champagnes.        
酒保，两杯香槟。

R:
> I kind of get it.     
我懂。

S:
> Root, what the hell are you doing?        
根，你搞什么呢？

R:
> Harold wanted me off the streets for a while after my latest brush with Samaritan, So I thought I'd help keep an ear on you. He is a dangerous criminal after all,        
哈罗德要我躲一阵子，刚才遭遇了“撒马利亚人”，所以我想帮你看着点。他毕竟是个危险的犯罪分子，我可不能忍受你被人伤害，      
I mean, besides me.     
除我之外，谁都不行。

S:
> So... What do you need me for?        
那么…你想让我干什么？

T:
> I can think of several things.        
我想让你干很多事。

R:
> Subtle.       
含蓄。

S:
> I'll bet. But, uh, for now let's just keep it professional. Now, I'm willing to guess that last night's job was a test to check the NYPD's response time, Which means that you have something bigger lined up.        
我猜也是。不过，我们现在还是专业点。我猜昨晚的活只是测试，是为了记录纽约警察的反应时间，也就是说你有更大的活。

R:
> See, now that was subtle.     
瞧，这才叫含蓄。

S:
> So... are you ready for another score?        
那么…你准备好干下一票了吗？

R:
> That not so much.     
不够含蓄了。

T:
> Maybe. But I'm not the kind of man who likes to rush. A perfectly planned job is a kind of seduction. Hours looking, wanting, turning your target around in your mind. And then... you move closer, brushing past, making contact just to see what will happen. And when everything's ready and when everything is right, all of that preparation pays off in one sudden, intense, crashing moment.       
也许吧。不过我不喜欢操之过急。一个完美的计划如同诱惑。长时间的关注、渴望、在脑海中反复回味目标，然后缓缓接近、擦肩而过、慢慢接触、观察反应。当一切就绪，一切到位，所有的前戏将会换来天雷勾动地火的燃情一刻。

R:
> He's good. But a line like that would never work on a trained operative like--        
他不错。不过这种台词绝对打动不了你这种职业特——

## 4.2. 00:19:38--00:19:41

R:
> Shaw. How's your date?        
肖。你的约会如何？

## 4.3. 00:21:29--00:22:33

H:
> Oh, dear, this is bad. This is very, very bad. Those labels don't say "Marv." They say "Mar-v," as in "Marburg virus," A viral hemorrhagic fever with a mortality rate approaching 90%.       
天啊，不妙了。大事不妙了。那些标签不是“马五”。而是“马毒”。指“马堡病毒”。一种病毒性出血热，死亡率接近90%。

R:
> It's like Ebola's evil twin.      
埃博拉的邪恶双胞胎。

H:
> Dr. Petrova was in Uganda collecting samples of the virus. But due to the outbreak of Ebola in western Africa, her request to ship them to the CDC was denied by Homeland Security. Rather than lose months of research, Dr. Petrova chose to smuggle them into the U.S. illegally.       
佩特洛娃博士在乌干达搜集这种病毒的样本。但是由于西非埃博拉病毒爆发，她把样本送回疾控中心的要求被国安局拒绝了。为了不浪费数月的研究心血，佩特洛娃博士把样本非法偷运回美国。

S:
> And now somebody stole them.      
现在却被人偷了。

R:
> If it makes you feel better, Dr. P's freaking out about it. She just turned herself in to her bosses at the CDC.      
如果能让你舒服点的话，佩博士现在吓得半死。她刚向疾控中心的负责人自首了。

H:
> It would be difficult to overstate the degree to which we do not need ten vials of Marburg floating around the streets of New York City. We have to find the virus and the people who stole it fast.      
简直不敢想象十瓶马堡病毒肆虐纽约是何等后果。我们得尽快找到病毒和盗窃者。

J:
> Okay, I'll track down Max and Henrik, but we need to know who they're working for.        
好，我去追踪麦克斯和亨里克，但我们得知道他们是替谁干活。

S:
> It was probably the same client who hired Tomas in the first place. Nobody else knew about the robbery.       
可能和当初雇佣托马斯的是同一个客户。其他人都不知道抢劫的事。

R:
> Plus, paying those two to kill Tomas is cheaper than paying all three.        
再说，给钱他们俩去杀了托马斯比付三个人的酬金要便宜。        
It is.      
本来就是。

## 4.4. 00:41:17--00:42:03

S:
> I'm sure not having the machine in your ear anymore sucks and all, but it is pretty great finally being able to sneak up on you.      
我知道没有机器在你耳边说话让你挺难过，不过终于能偷偷吓你一跳还是挺爽的。

R:
> I live to amuse.      
我乐故我在。        
Where's Tomas?      
托马斯呢？

S:
> Halfway to Barcelona. He gave me a pretty hard sell, trying to get me to go with him, and for a hot second, I almost did.     
去巴塞罗那的路上。他给了我个挺好的提议，让我和他一起走，有那么一刻，我几乎答应了。

R:
> But?      
但是呢？

S:
> I guess there are things I care about here.       
也许，这里还有我在乎的东西。

R:
> And is that why you came to see me?       
所以你跑来看我？

S:
> No.
不。
I need you to translate finch's instructions on how to destroy the virus. Dude never met a five-syllable word he didn't like.       
我需要你翻译芬奇如何摧毁病毒的指示。这哥们狂恋高端词啊。

R:
> Full decontamination.     
全面净化。      
This could take all night.      
得花上一整夜。

停得漂亮。

R:
> We're in a camera dead-zone.      
这里是无监控区。

S:
> I'm guessing the psycho blonde wasn't there for our free tote bag promotion.      
看来那金发疯子不是去享受免费赠袋促销的。

R:
> No. Your cover's been blown.      
不是。你的掩护身份暴露了。

W:
> That's the last of it.

她在这儿，哈罗。

H:
> Oh, thank goodness. And you're okay, Ms. Shaw?        
谢天谢地。你还好吧，肖女士？

S:
> If by "okay," you mean, "ready to kick some righteous ass." I thought Samaritan couldn't see us.      
好得足以去教训几个装逼的。我还以为撒马利亚人看不到我们。

R:
> It can't. But its operatives can.     
它看不到。但它的特工能看到。

S:
> If I was about to be capped, Shouldn't my number have come up?        
我差点儿掉脑袋，我的号码不应该会跳出来吗？

H:
> Assuming that the machine saw the threat, yes. But the fact that it didn't suggests that we're not the only ones who've learned how to operate in the  shadows. Samaritan's agents have, as well.     
要是机器看到了威胁，是会。但它却没有。这就说明不只是我们学会了于阴影中隐藏行动。撒马利亚人的特工也会了。

R:
> Look on the bright side, Sameen. I'm pretty sure you just sold you last tube of luminizer.        
往好处想，萨姆恩。你肯定是再也不用卖修饰乳了。

H:
> Indeed. Ms. Shaw, You and Ms. Groves have to avoid all cameras and get back here as soon as you can. Use the shadow map.      
正是。肖女士，你和格罗夫斯女士必须避开所有的摄像头尽快赶回来。使用阴影地图。

S:
> That's gonna be tricky considering... We're in a truck with no clue where we're heading.      
这可有点棘手了…我们在辆卡车上，不知道是在哪儿。

H:

我有你们的位置。派帮手去了。

S:
> So when we get back to the subway... Then what?       
等我们回到地铁站…然后呢？

H:
> Then we'll keep you safe.     
然后保护你的安全。

S:
> No, I mean, what if we get a new number?      
不，要是我们有新号码呢？

H:
> Not to worry. I'm sure Mr. Reese can handle anything that comes along.        
不用担心。我坚信里瑟先生能应付一切情况。

## 5.2. 00:06:00--00:06:34

我肯定哈罗会有办法的。

S:
> I already have. The machine needs to give me a new identity.      
我有办法。机器得给我个新身份。

R:
> Sorry, Sam, it doesn't work like that.        
抱歉，萨姆，办不到。

S:
> Why not? I mean, it works like that for you. You go through identities like they're Dixie cups. But I'm one and done?     
为什么？你不就这样嘛。你换身份跟换包装一样。我就只能有一个？

R:
> I don't make the rules.       
规矩不是我定的。        
She does.       
是她定的。

我知道你很郁闷，生气，或者还有点害怕——

S:
> Please. I'm not scared.       
拜托。我才不怕。

R:
> Maybe you should be. Because you almost died back there. And Samaritan's operatives are just getting smarter and faster. So while you may not be scared about what could happen to you the next time, other people are. People who care for you.      
也许你应该害怕。因为你刚才差点就死了。撒马利亚人的特工越来越聪明，越来越迅速。所以就算你不怕，下次会发生什么事，别人会怕。在乎你的人会怕。      
Try to remember that.       
给我记住。

有新消息吗，肖女士？

S:
> Yeah, one. We're still breathing.

很好。越快回来越好。你们遇上的那个特工刚审问了弗斯科警探。他转移了她的注意力。

好样的，莱奈尔。

H:

情况允许时我会与你联系。但现在，我得去帮里瑟先生。

他在搞什么鬼？

R:
> Trying to protect you.        
在保护你。

S:
> I don't need protection, okay? I do the protecting.       
我不用保护，好吗？只有我保护别人的份。      
Now, do you know where John is?     
你知道约翰在哪儿吗？

R:
> Sameen, we already have a mission.        
萨米恩，我们有别的任务了。

S:
> That means "Yes." Tell me. Tell me. Root!     
那就是知道。告诉我。告诉我。根！        
Please.     
求你啦~

R:
> Cute, but--       
真可爱，不过——

S:
> If you don't tell me where John is right now, I'm not going any further. Samaritan's goons can just come and blast us into the next dimension.        
你不立马告诉我约翰在哪，我就不走了。撒马利亚人的喽啰就过来把我们炸到异次元去好了。

R:
> Fine.     
好吧。      
But we use the shadow map to get there. And as soon as we help John, you promise to go underground.     
但我们需要阴影地图才能到。一旦帮完约翰，你保证马上躲起来。

成交。

Remember our deal. We do this, then straight to the subway.     
记住之前的约定。干完这个，直接回地铁站。

好啦好啦。你真会煞风景。

S:

你确定是这里吗？

怎么回事？

R:

S:
> How could you let her do this to me, Finch-- tranq me like I'm some kind of animal?       
你怎么能让她这么对我，芬奇。把我当动物似的直接下药？

H:
> It was for your own good, Ms. Shaw. You are no longer safe from Samaritan's gaze, and you wouldn't listen to reason.      
这是为了你好，肖女士。你在撒马利亚人的监视上不再安全了，你又不肯听话。

R:

他说得对，萨姆。你是真不听话。

S:
> You turned on me, Harold. Not cool.       
你背叛我，哈罗德。不厚道。

求和礼物。      
It's the Beatrice Lillie from Park's Deli, including the extra ingredients you enjoy.       
从朴氏熟食店买的毕翠丝·莉莉，额外加了你喜欢的料。

> Here... Let me help you. Two hands are better than one.       
来…我帮你。两只手好过一只手。

S:
> So how long do you nerds expect to keep me locked up?     
你们俩宅客能把我关到啥时候？

R:
> Until it's safe for you.      
关到你安全为止。

H:
> And us. If Samaritan and its human agents discover you, it could lead them to every single one of us.     
加上我们。要是撒马利亚人及其执行人发现了你，它会直接追踪到我们每一个人。

S:
> Guilt, Harold? Really? You know, normally that wouldn't work on me, but I wouldn't want anything to happen to the dog.        
玩内疚战，哈罗德？真的么？姐一般可不吃这一套，不过，我不想伤害到 狗狗。

R:
> I'm glad we all agree you're going to stay put, especially since we know it would be impossible to keep you locked up... against your will, anyway.       
很高兴我们达成共识你留在原地。其实我们也知道，不太可能关住你…要是你真不乐意的话。

S:
> So true.      
太对了。        
And what happens when we get a new number?      
我们有新号码怎么办？

H:
> Mr. Reese is handling one now. I'm sure he'll be fine on his own until we get this matter sorted out.     
里瑟先生现在正在处理。我相信他没事的，能撑到我们解决问题。

## 6.2. 00:07:54--00:08:13

S:
> Why is Samaritan working the numbers?     
撒马利亚人为什么会处理号码？

H:
> Samaritan doesn't care about the irrelevant numbers, Ms. Shaw. It wasn't programmed that way.     
撒马利亚人不在乎无关号码，肖女士。它的程序中不存在。

R:
> But it knew this woman was about to commit murder and chose to play judge, jury, and executioner with her husband.        
但它知道这个女人即将杀人，就出手扮演她丈夫的法官、陪审团、执刑人。

H:
> It's drawing attention to itself. But for what reason?        
它想吸引注意。但为什么呢？

## 6.3. 00:08:46--00:11:59

S:
> You got to admit, Samaritan's pretty efficient.       
不得不承认，撒马利亚人相当高效。

H:
> But not efficient enough to stop the numbers from coming. We've just received a new one. I've sent John to investigate.       
再高效也没挡住号码继续跳出来。我们刚收到新号码了。我派约翰去调查了。

S:
> I meant from stopping an innocent woman from making a terrible mistake, taking out the bad guy.       
至少阻止了无辜女子铸成大错，打击坏蛋。

H:
> Yes, however, that bad guy deserved a trial by his peers.     
就算是吧，那个坏蛋也有权利接受审判。

S:
> He saved the government some time and money.      
他可帮政府节省了时间和金钱。

H:
> Are you ready for instantaneous judgment decided by an artificial intelligence that will lead to your demise, Ms. Shaw? Because I most certainly am not.      
你愿意接受人工智能的瞬间判断来决定你的死亡吗，肖女士？我可是不愿意。

S:
> Okay. Not to stick up for Team Samaritan, but I used to do that for a living, remember? Eliminate targets at the behest of an A.I. I just didn't know who was giving the orders.      
好吧。不是想为撒马利亚小分队叫好，可我以前就是干这个活儿的，记得吗？听从人工智能的命令消除目标。我当时只是不知道谁下的令。      
Look, why don't you ask Root what she thinks? She's the one who wants us to bow down to our robot overlords.        
你干嘛不问问根的想法？她才一门心思想我们全跪倒在机器人主子膝下。

R:
> The machine isn't a robot, Sam, but I hear your analogy. It seems that Samaritan has been helping people across the city for a few days now. The machine sent me a message. She said that Rachel Farrow was just one of its stops.        
机器不是机器人，萨姆，不过我明白你的比喻。看来撒马利亚人最近几天一直在城里救人。机器给了我句话，她说雷切尔·法罗只是其中之一。

H:
> That tracks with what I'm seeing here—buses, subways, trains, all running like clockwork. Nothing broken. Nothing delayed. When was the last time that  happened in New York?     
根据我现在看到的情况——巴士、地铁、火车运行精确如钟表。毫无损坏。毫无延迟。你几时在纽约见过这种情况？

S:
> In my dreams, maybe.      
在我梦里见过吧。

R:
> Samaritan's running the city.     
撒马利亚人在控制整个城市。

H:
> I believe it is. But why?     
我相信是的。但为什么呢？

R:
> What if it's trying to reach out to the machine the only way it knows how.        
也许是因为它想接触机器，这是它唯一的办法。

S:
> But then why do it this way? Why not just-- I don't know. How do artificial super intelligences usually talk to each other?       
但为什么用这种方式呢？为什么不直接——我不知道超级人工智能之间通常怎么聊天？

H:
> These machines have avoided making contact with one another for good reason. If two dueling A.S.I.s arrive at anything short of consensus, the outcome could be catastrophic.     
机器之间避免接触是有原因的。只要两个对立的超级人工智能之间稍有龃龉，后果都将是灾难性的。

R:
> Two angry gods hurling boulders at one another while the ants scurry below.       
两个愤怒的上帝互殴，下面的蝼蚁就要遭殃了。

H:
> This may be a request for peace talks.        
这也许是请求和平协商。

S:
> Maybe they should just kiss and make up.      
也许那两货应该亲亲小嘴儿，摸摸小手儿。

H:
> To what end, Ms. Shaw?        
然后呢，肖女士？        
Samaritan's plans will be many hundreds, if not thousands, of steps beyond what we can imagine.     
撒马利亚人的计划可能百步，甚至千步领先于我们的猜想。

R:
> The machine will protect us.      
机器会保护我们。

H:
> Even if I had succeeded in creating a benevolent machine, as if any such thing could exist, never forget that even a so-called friendly artificial super intelligence would be every bit as dangerous as an unfriendly one.       
就算是我造了一台有悲悯之心的机器，就算这种可能性存在，也别忘了就算是所谓“友善”的超级人工智能，也跟非友善的一样危险。

S:
> Your machine seems pretty warm and fuzzy to me.       
我觉得你的机器挺温柔挺贴心。

H:
> Have you forgotten that it asked us to kill a congressman?        
你忘了它曾让我们去谋杀国会议员吗？

S:
> But that was to stop Samaritan from going online.     
但那是为了阻止撒马利亚人上线。

H:
> So where does it end, Ms. Shaw? A congressman here, a president there. What if, one day, a friendly A.I. decides to end world hunger by killing enough people off of the planet that there would never again be a shortage of food? It would have fulfilled its goal, but it doesn't exactly sound like it has our best interests at heart.       
那底线何在呢，肖女士？这里有议员，那里还有总统。如果有一天，友善的人工智能决定为了解决饥饿问题，要杀死地球上足够数量的人以保证永远不会再出现食物短缺呢？这样就能实现它的目标，它可不会把我们的真正利益放在心上。

R:
> Your machine would never do that.     
你的机器绝不会那么做的。

H:
> You don't know that, Ms. Groves. To say that a machine is benevolent doesn't make it so. It just makes you blind to the reality.      
你不能保证，格罗夫斯女士。说机器有悲悯之心并不代表就是如此。那只会让你认不清现实。

S:
> Which is?     
什么现实？

H:
> That our moral system will never be mirrored by theirs because of the very simple reason that they are not human.     
我们的道德体系无法被取代，理由很简单，他们不是人类。

## 6.4. 00:16:49--00:17:18

S:
> I still think this could be a good thing, boys. We could take a little vacay. I looking kind of pasty. How about it, Harold? You are looking kind of pasty.       
我看这是好事啊，小子们。我们可以休个假。我是挺想去晒晒太阳的。怎么样，哈罗德？你看着挺苍白啊。

H:
> This is the calm before the storm, Ms. Shaw. The only question is, when will the sky open?        
这是暴风雨前的平静，肖女士。唯一的问题是，几时倾盆。

R:
> It's looking overcast, Harold.        
乌云密布啊，哈罗德。

H:
> Where are you, Ms. Groves?        
你在哪里，格罗夫斯女士？

R:
> Downtown. She sent me GPS coordinates that fall inside the shadow map. I think she wants me to find someone important. I just don't know who.     
下城区。她给了我GPS坐标。在阴影地图范围内。她应该是要安排我见个重要人物。我只是不知道是谁。

## 6.5. 00:23:55--00:24:31

S:
> Root...       
根…

R:
> How's my favorite prisoner?       
我的宝贝囚犯怎么样啊？

S:
> Better than the rest of you. Trains are down all over town, there are traffic outages everywhere in the city, and the crime rate has spiked 50% since yesterday.      
比你们其他人好多了。整座城市的火车都停运了，全市各处都在堵车，从昨天起犯罪率激增了50%。

R:
> Samaritan is making itself known.     
撒马利亚人正在证明自己的存在。

S:
> Shot Spotter I.D.'d over 20 gunshots In the last two hours, and I don't even want to guess how many of those ended up in a homicide.      
射击定位两小时内发现了二十多起枪击案，我都不敢想其中多少起造成了人员伤亡。

R:
> Three, according to Lionel. Samaritan's turning people against each other, revealing their secrets, unlocking doors that were never meant to be opened in the first place.        
三起，莱奈尔说的。撒马利亚人想让人自相残杀，暴露秘密，打开那些不该被开启的罪恶之门。

## 6.6. 00:24:54--00:25:33

S:
> What happened to you?     
你怎么了？

H:
> I was able to rescue one of our numbers, but I'm afraid his office building wasn't so fortunate. There was a bit of an explosion.     
我救下了一个号码，但恐怕他的办公楼就没那么幸运了。发生了点小爆炸。

S:
> How long can we go on like this, Finch? We've already lost six.       
我们这样还能撑多久，芬奇？已经失去六个人了。

R:
> Seven.        
七人。

S:
> Look, if Samaritan wants a sit-down, I think it's time we do it. Aren't we supposed to be saving lives here?      
撒马利亚人想谈判，我看是时候答应了。我们不是要救人活命吗？

H:
> Look at what's happened to the city today. If this conversation goes badly, imagine what it will look like when two gods go to war.       
看看这座城市现在什么模样了。如果谈话谈崩了，想想两位上帝开战的后果。

R:
> It's not our choice to make, Harold. I got a message from the machine. She says it's time.        
这个由不得我们决定，哈罗德。我刚收到机器的话。她说是时候了。

## 6.7. 00:30:54--00:31:36

H:
> She'll be fine, Ms. Shaw.     
她没事的，肖女士。

S:
> She's going to meet An all-seeing, all-evil god by herself. That doesn't sound fine to me. That sounds like someone who needs backup.     
她要独自去见一个全知全能的邪恶上帝。我不觉得这叫没事。她需要支援。

H:
> I won't pretend that I'm not concerned, but Ms. Groves believes the machine will protect her.     
我并不是假装不担心，但格罗夫斯女士相信机器会保护她。

S:
> But you don't believe that, do you, Harold?       
但你并不相信，对吗，哈罗德？

H:
> I never imagined we would get this far, not once Samaritan became active, and yet, here we are.       
我从没有料到我们会到这一步，撒马利亚人上线时都没有，如今事已至此。

S:
> Yeah, here we are, hiding... underground in an abandoned subway while one of our own walks into certain death, alone.     
是啊，事已至此，我们躲在…一个废弃的地铁站，而我们其中一位正走向死亡，独自一个人。

H:
> There is one thing of which I am most certain.        
有件事我非常肯定。      
Root is not alone.      
根不是一个人。

## 6.8. 00:42:12--00:42:37

H:
> Root, are you okay?       
根，你没事吧？

R:
> I'm fine, but the conversation between the two parties ended at an impasse.       
我没事，不过双方的谈话以僵局告终。

H:
> Unfortunately, that's not our only problem.       
不幸的是，我们还有其他麻烦。

R:
> What is it, Harry?        
什么麻烦，哈罗？

H:
> Ms. Shaw is gone.     
肖女士不见了。

R:
> Where?        
哪儿？

H:
> I can only imagine that she's come to help you and John with the numbers. Where are you?      
我猜她去帮你和约翰救号码了。你在哪儿？

R:
> The machine sent me information. It led to Wall Street, but there's no specific address. I'm not certain what it means yet.       
机器给我了消息。要我去华尔街，但没有具体地址。我还不确定是什么意思。
